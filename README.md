# **PID Temperature Control System with Real-Time Graphs**

![](/images/graph.png)

## Objective
This project aims to develop a PID control system to maintain the air temperature within a specified range using Arduino Nano. The system controls the temperature of the airflow expelled through a tube by a fan, regulated between 35°C and 45°C using a halogen lamp.

## Control Method
The system utilizes a discrete PID controller, allowing real-time adjustment of Kp, Ki, and Kd values via potentiometers displayed on an LCD
